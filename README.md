## Features

- **Full 3D Interactive Periodic Table** with responsive design
- **Detailed Bohr Model** visualization for each element
- **Animated Electron Orbits** that move according to physical principles
- **Comprehensive Element Information** including:
  - Physical properties
  - Electron configuration
  - Discovery information
  - Summary and applications
  - Hazard information
- **Smart Search Functionality** that supports:
  - Search by element name, symbol, or atomic number
  - Search by element category (e.g., "alkali metals", "noble gases")
  - Search by hazard property (e.g., "toxic", "radioactive", "flammable")
- **Element Categorization** with color-coding for different element types
- **Hazard Indicators** showing safety information for each element

## How to Use

1. **Browse the Periodic Table** by scrolling and panning around the 3D environment
2. **Click on any element** to see its detailed 3D atomic model
3. **Use the search bar** to find elements by name, symbol, category, or hazard
4. **Explore the 3D model** by:
   - Dragging to rotate the view
   - Scrolling to zoom in and out
5. **View detailed information** in the side panel for each element

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **React** for UI components
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **Bohr Model Physics** for electron configuration visualization

## Setup

No installation required! This is a standalone HTML application that runs directly in the browser.
